# Location-Based Android Chat App
Location-based messaging application, built for Android with Java. The Application was built using Android Studio, whilst Google Firebase was used to store data and to and provide back-end services, including notifications and authentication. 

A core aspect of the development process was to create a 'location-aware', application, which would respond and interact with other near-by app users. For this, the Google Maps API was used to obtain the users current coordinates, alongside [Geofire API](https://github.com/firebase/geofire-java) which was used to calculate if any other users were geographically close. 

Use cases included emergency scenarios, whereby somebody needing assistance can instantly message any nearby users for help, or for message-based work meetings, where users do not need to have each others contact details stored prior to initiating a new chat as long as they are geographically proximate, and also, meeting new people when traveling solo whilst staying at hostel-like accomodation.
